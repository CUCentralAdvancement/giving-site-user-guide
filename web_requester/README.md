# Web Requester User Role

Web Requesters control all aspects of how funds are marketed on the website including creating Landing Pages,
Vanity URLs, and Fund Page marketing content. 

## Login

After you log into the website, you will be taken to the content area...need to check if this is true.

Types of content:
- Landing Pages
- [Fund Pages](fund-pages.md) - Funds users can donate to.

  on the Giving website or another service Central Advancement uses.
