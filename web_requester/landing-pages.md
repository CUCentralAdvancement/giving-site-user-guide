# Landing Pages

Landing pages allow for you to market several funds with content listed above the funds. You can also 
specify an allocation code that gets attached to any user's session when they visit the page.

## Workfront Form

You will use a generic request form for landing pages since there is no direct form like for funds or 
VURLs.
