# Fund Pages

Funds requests are managed by the Digital Marketing team. You can read about the process of adding 
and editing funds in the [content editor documentation on funds](../content_editor/fund-pages.md).

## Fund Requests

You can fill out a fund request form at:
https://universityofcolorado.my.workfront.com/requests?activeTab=tab-new-helpRequest&projectID=5e78b9c9013651dd0db330e625ca787c&path=5e78be160139141988101a91b47abd33,5e7986c20198f9afb658ba1f7fee957f

### Marketing Content

Most of the fields for funds are straightforward, but the Marketing Content field allows you complete 
control over what content to put after the fund description on the fund page. This is useful for 
adding images and text that provide the user with a better experience while making a donation.

Sometimes official descriptions can be short and not very detailed. In the case of endowed vs. 
non-endowed funds or funds with similar names, it can be hard for users to distinguish between two funds.

For these reasons, it is recommended to always add a Marketing Content section to the fund page. Not 
only does it make the page look more attractive to users, but it also makes the page content more 
attractive to search engines so you will get better search rankings when donors search for your fund.

### Keywords and Interests

Users find funds in a search via the Interests listed on a fund, but they can also secretly search 
for a fund based on a keyword. 

However, it is not recommended to use keywords anymore as the marketing content is indexed within 
search results. Google and other SEO tools will rank your content more highly if you use the 
marketing content field, but using the keyword field does not help at all with SEO.

Interests are a better classification mechanism than keywords, but unfortunately, they are not 
officially recognised. In the future, requesters should collaborate on a shared definition of what 
interests should be included as choices so users can better find funds in the search.

## Fund Sync Process

The fund's title and description are checked every night and updated if a change is detected. 
Therefore, you can only request "Marketing Content" to be added beneath the official description 
without the ability to control what the official description says.
