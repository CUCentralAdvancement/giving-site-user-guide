# FAQs

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS) are commonly used on websites to gather information that doesn't 
fit into the other sections of the website but might help users navigate to information they need. It 
is also a good place to put information that is frequently asked by users but only takes a little bit 
of content to explain.

## FAQ Creation

Someone might request to add a FAQ via the general website support request form. When they do that, 
oftentimes a Word doc is attached that has the details of the FAQ content. In the future, a separate 
form for FAQs should be created to make the content entry process easier.

You can create an FAQ on the Giving site by going to:
1. https://giving.cu.edu/node/add/faq
2. Adding the title from the WF request comments or the Word doc into the "Question" field.
3. Choose a category from the "Category" dropdown. There's no good advice on what category to choose 
   or if there should be more categories so make your best judgement.
4. Ignore the "Detailed Question" field.
5. Add the main FAQ content from the WF request comments or the Word doc into the "Answer" field.
6. Choose the "Content Owners" based on the content of the FAQ. If you can't determine a campus add 
   "Central Advancement" as the owner.

## FAQ Editing

Unlike the other content types, sometimes it can be hard to find the page that has an edit button on 
it so you should search for the FAQ on the 
[content overview page](https://giving.cu.edu/admin/content?type=faq) and click "Edit" on that screen.

## FAQ Ordering

Ordering of the FAQs is a bit weird. You can't change the order on the individual FAQs, but you can 
change the order on the main FAQ page.

To change the order:
